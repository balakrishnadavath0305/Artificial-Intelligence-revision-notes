# **Generative AI agents:**

gen ai agents are designed to act on your behalf by using goals, context and tools often with a degree of autonomy

Instead of just making a conversation it performs more tasks 

##### **Process:**

1)Understands the query

2)determines necessary actions

3)Collects required data

4)Executes actions

##### 

##### **Gen AI agents vs Agentic AI:**

1\) ***Gen AI*** is reactive, that reacts based on the prompts. It is semi autonomous and works in multiple steps only if it is designed in that way, and memory is stateless

2\) ***Agentic AI*** is proactive, it doesn't require any prompt to perform actions, it automatically performs tasks in steps and it has a good memory capability. Think of it like an autonomous vehicle



These both overlap on venn diagram which means that not all Gen AI agents are agentic and vice versa



##### **Gen Ai agents core components:**

***1)Goal:*** identifies goal of the task

***2)Memory:*** uses past data 

***3)Tools:*** access to calendar, wen API's

***4)Planner:*** Architect thinks and analyse the achievement of goal

***5)Executor:*** executes the planning



##### **Applications:**

Finance, Marketing, and Human Resources
