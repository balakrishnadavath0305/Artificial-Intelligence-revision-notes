# **What is AI?** 



Artificial Intelligence, just like Human Intelligence computers can also have intelligence. So AI includes AGI, ANI, Generative AI

**1)AGI(Artificial General Intelligence):** computers having all the capabilities of human like learning, thinking and analyzing but its still  hypothetical.

**2)ANI(Artificial Narrow Intelligence):** Computers having intelligence and limited to a specific task like spam filtering, face recognition unlock etc

**3)Generative AI:** Computers can create new thinks like chatgpt text or code, DALLE can create images but these cannot check themselves.



##### **Relation b/w AI,ML,DL, and Gen AI**

***AI:*** Machines having intelligence like humans

***ML:*** Algorithms that can learn from past data and trends and predict outcomes

***Dl:*** subset of ML that uses Neural networks for prediction

***Gen AI:*** AI that can create new content



###### **AI tasks:**

***1)Language related AI tasks:***

&nbsp;Text related: text as input and extracting particular info. Ex: Translating from one language to other

&nbsp;Gen AI tasks: creating poem, story etc.

***2)Speech related AI tasks:***

&nbsp;Speech related: audio as speech as input and generating various types 

&nbsp;Gen AI tasks: generating any audio

***3)Vision related AI tasks:***

&nbsp;Image related: Image as input and various tasks. Ex: Facial recognition for security tasks

&nbsp;gen AI tasks: Creating images 



##### **AI advantages:**

&nbsp;Automates tasks, 

&nbsp;Extend human capabilities

&nbsp;Cost reduction and Revenue growth by reduced labour and increased product recommendations respectively



AI learns from multiple data types such as numbers, text, images and audio



##### **Labeled vs Unlabeled data**

***1)Labeled:*** Training data always includes labels such as "spam", "not spam" for emails and "cat", "dog" for animals, so Ai tries to corelate inputs and outputs

***2)Unlabeled:*** System clusters based on some features. Example data is reviews in amazon without ratings, social media posts etc



AI's performance mostly depends on the data

***1)Dirty data:*** missing values, noisy data etc

***2)Biased data:*** AI picks up human prejudice

&nbsp;  like a hiring AI prefers gender if 3 out of 4 hired by human are men
