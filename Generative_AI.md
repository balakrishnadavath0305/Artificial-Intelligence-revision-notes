# Generative AI: 

is an artificial intelligence where the AI can create new content like text, video, images and audio unlike traditional AI's which focus on analysis and prediction.

Ex-Chatgpt creating text, and copilot creating codes



##### **Progression of genAi**

*1)Small supervised learning*

*2)Large supervised learning*

*3)Generative AI*

why progression: large amounts of data, graphics, and ambition



##### **GenAI types:**

***1)Large Language Models:*** that can create text, code and act like a brain

***2)Diffusion model:*** Acts like an artist that can convert text into images, videos and audios



**LLM + Diffusion Model = Multi modal**



***1)Large language Model(LLM):*** is a probabilistic model of text which assigns probability to each word and predicts the most likely word coming next based on the previous text

Large means more number of parameters, more the number of parameters more the performance and creation 



***2)Diffusion model:*** starts with a noise data and slowly turns into a meaningful image by denoising it



##### **Generative AI applications:**

1)text generation

2)Image generation

3)Multi modal systems



##### **Risks:**

1)Deep fake: creating a fake media which is realistic

2)Bias: just like before hiring, reinforcing stereotypes

3)Hallucination: confidently creating false facts

4)Copyright and ip issues
