# **Deep Learning:** 

Deep learning is inspired by human brain where neurons transmit information. It is a type of machine learning where the computer tries to understand complex patterns like facial recognition, language translation, speech comprehension using neural networks with many layers



##### **Neural networks:** 

are the building blocks of DL. It is a collection of neurons where it consists of input layer, hidden layer and output layer. CNNs for images, and RNNs for sequential



##### **How DL process:**

Inputs are multiplied with weights associated and bias is applied, then based on the threshold the final output is provided. take an example of the loan application



##### **Deep learning training:**

&nbsp;***1)Forward propagation:*** Inputs are multiplied with weights by passing through various layers and make a prediction based on the bias.

&nbsp;***2)Backward propagation:*** Based on the prediction and true values the loss function is identified, then optimizer updates the weights and bias to reduce minimize the loss function



##### **Applications:**

1)Chatbot assistants

2)Speech to text translators

3)Image recognition systems in self driving cars
