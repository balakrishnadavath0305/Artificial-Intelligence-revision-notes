# **Machine Learning:** 

Computers learn from past data to make future decisions without telling exactly what to do

&nbsp;Ex: Training a dog: we train a dog(action and reward/punish based), Facial recognition: Children learn to observe patterns in faces by observing lot of faces without needing to tell exactly about faces



##### **Machine learning process:**

***1)Input:*** input data for training it can be of any type

***2)Pattern finding:*** machine tries to identify patterns in the input data

***3)Output:*** prediction or decision based on the pattern finding



***Features:*** are the clues that computer uses, things it can measure or observe

***Labels:*** Correct answer or outcome that we want machine to learn to predict



So Features-Clues, Labels-solution, Model-brain of the system



***Training phase:*** we provide features and labels like questions and answers

***Prediction phase:*** we provide features then the model predicts the labels





##### **Types of Machine Learning:**

###### **1)Supervised learning:** is a type of machine learning that trains a model using features and labels

&nbsp;  Examples include House price prediction, email spam or not, and cat vs dog classification



***i)Regression:*** is a type of supervised learning that predicts values or numbers not categories

&nbsp; Regression analysis is used to estimate one or more dependent variables(labels) based on changing related variables(features)



&nbsp;	Line fitting problem:

&nbsp;	To make predictions regression tries to find the best fit line that minimizes the distance b/w the points and the line



***ii)Classification:*** is a supervised learning that predicts a category not a value

&nbsp;classification analysis is used to predict category of two or more variables(labels) based on the related variables(features)

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	Decision boundary problem:

&nbsp;	To make a prediction classifier tries to draw a boundary that tries to separate categories of given datapoints

###### **2)Unsupervised learning:** is a type of machine learning that trains a model using features without any labels(answers)

&nbsp; Grouping based on similarities

&nbsp; Ex: Product recommendation, Ana moly detection, customer segmentation

&nbsp; Clustering forms clusters and places a centroid at the center representing the typical behaviour of the segment
